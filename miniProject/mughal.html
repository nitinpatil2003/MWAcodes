    <h1>Administration & Policies of the Mughal Dynasty</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Central Administration</h2>
      <p>The Mughal Empire followed a strong centralized system led by the Emperor. The emperor was the supreme authority in military, judicial, legislative, and executive matters. Key officials included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wazir:</strong> Prime Minister and head of the finance department.</li>
        <li><strong>Mir Bakshi:</strong> In charge of military administration and recruitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Sadr-us-Sudr:</strong> Oversaw religious matters, charities, and endowments.</li>
        <li><strong>Diwan-i-Insha:</strong> Managed correspondence and royal decrees.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Provincial Administration</h2>
      <p>The empire was divided into provinces known as <strong>Subahs</strong>. Each Subah was headed by a <strong>Subahdar</strong> who handled civil, military, and financial responsibilities. Key provincial officials included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diwan:</strong> Provincial finance officer.</li>
        <li><strong>Bakshi:</strong> In charge of military affairs in the province.</li>
        <li><strong>Qazi:</strong> Judge responsible for law and justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Kotwal:</strong> Head of police in cities.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3. Military Organization – Mansabdari System</h2>
      <p>Introduced by Akbar, the <strong>Mansabdari system</strong> was a unique military-civil ranking system. Every officer (mansabdar) held a rank which determined his salary and the number of cavalrymen he was expected to maintain. It helped the emperor maintain control and reduce feudal power.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. Revenue System – Zabt and Dahsala</h2>
      <p>The Mughal revenue system under Akbar was called the <strong>Dahsala system</strong> or <strong>Zabt system</strong>, implemented by Raja Todar Mal. It was based on land measurement and productivity over ten years, with fixed tax rates. Taxes were mostly paid in cash, which encouraged monetization of the economy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Religious Policy</h2>
      <p>The Mughals followed varied religious policies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Babur & Humayun:</strong> Orthodox but tolerant.</li>
        <li><strong>Akbar:</strong> Known for his <em>policy of religious tolerance</em> called <strong>Sulh-i-Kul</strong> (peace with all). He abolished the Jizya tax on non-Muslims and encouraged dialogue between religions.</li>
        <li><strong>Aurangzeb:</strong> Reversed this policy; re-imposed Jizya and destroyed some temples, leading to unrest.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Judicial System</h2>
      <p>The emperor was the highest court of appeal. The judicial system was based on Islamic law (Sharia), but Hindus were allowed to follow their own customs. Key legal officials included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Qazi:</strong> Judge who decided civil and criminal cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Mufti:</strong> Legal adviser who interpreted Sharia.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. Intelligence and Espionage</h2>
      <p>Mughal emperors maintained a strong espionage system. Spies were appointed in every region and reported directly to the emperor to keep him informed of regional happenings, ensuring loyalty and stability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Trade and Commerce Policies</h2>
      <p>The Mughals promoted internal and external trade. They developed roads, established sarais (rest houses), and secured trade routes. Ports like Surat and Cambay flourished under their reign. Akbar’s policy of religious tolerance also helped encourage foreign trade.</p>
