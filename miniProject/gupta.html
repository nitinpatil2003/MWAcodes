    <h2>Central Administration</h2>
    <p>
      The Gupta Empire had a strong centralized administration with the emperor at the top.
      Provinces were governed by Kumaras (princes) or governors. There was a well-defined bureaucracy,
      and local administration was handled by village councils and city boards.

    <h2>Military and Law</h2>
    <p>
      The Gupta kings maintained a powerful military and encouraged peace and prosperity. Law and order
      were upheld by a judicial system influenced by Hindu Dharmaśāstra. Punishments were generally mild
      and reformative in nature.

    <h2>Economic and Cultural Policies</h2>
    <p>
      The Gupta period is often referred to as the Golden Age of India due to the flourishing of arts,
      science, and literature. Trade was encouraged, both inland and overseas, and coinage was standardized.
      Religious tolerance was practiced, promoting a harmonious society.
